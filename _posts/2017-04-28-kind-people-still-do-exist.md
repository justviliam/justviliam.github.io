Long story short: I lost my passport here in Bangkok. I had to go to police station (not important right now) and then I arranged a meeting in Slovak embassy in Bangkok.

## Sir, it will be 1500 thai baht (about 40 eur)

So 1500 baht for new passport. I was like &#8211; ok, it is not that much. But obviously, I got my lesson, haha. You guys who know me &#8211; this is probably nothing surprising to you. I lose my stuff all the time. Maybe I even programmed my subconscious mind for this, lol. So I should stop talking about how I lose my things&#8230; From now on!

Ok, so I rather took 2000 baht with me. You know, just in case.

When it came to paying &#8211; dame told me &#8211; well, mr. Brozman &#8211; given the fact that you lost your passport. It will be 3000 baht. All of a sudden my dreams were ruined in a milisecond. God damn it. I tried my charm and persuasion. I told her: &#8220;can I bring you the money tomorrow?&#8221;. And she replied just the short and yet meaningful: &#8220;No&#8230;&#8221;

Ok, so I was trying to rearrange another meeting with her. And then it happened&#8230;

## How much do you need for that?

Woman in late forties asked me from my back. And I told her &#8211; well, around 1200 baht (ok, I lied, I did not have full 2k with me, cause I had to pay deposit on the reception&#8230; but I cannot state all of the details you know. This story would get super long otherwise.)

She just reached for her wallet and pulled 1200 (**32 eur**) baht out of it. And gave it to me.

I was super shocked and thankful at the same time. I looked at her and told her: &#8220;gimme your bank acc. So that I can send you the money back.&#8221; She said &#8211; no, just send it to some sort of a charity, which you like :O

So this is what happens when you are nice to people, haha. Cause I have talked a little bit with this lady. We just have some chit chat about Asia and other stuff.

## But how much did you send to charity, huh?

Well, I do not think that it is that important here. But I sent some money already.

Not to the charity, but to organization that has been very helpful to all of us. And I bet that everybody uses it from time to time.

Hint: no ads there and to of useful information in one place. And it is a non-profit organization. But about this later ðŸ™‚
