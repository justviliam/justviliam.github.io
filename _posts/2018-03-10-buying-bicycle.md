Using bicycle for transport in Nha Trang is very convenient, cheap and ecological. And it is also a lot of fun. I mean fighting for survival has always been a pleasurable activity for me. So I can fight for my life on the streets every day. What a joy.

## Where to buy a cheap bicycle

Place is located about 2.5 kilometers from main beach, let's say about 30 minutes walk. Depends how good you are at this particular activity.

In fact, there are two shops on this street. But I will tell you about my experience.

Here are gonna be some maps, photos and shit :D

## How much

250,000 VND

500,000 VND

1,250,000 VND

First two prices are for second hand bikes. The last price is for the brand new bike. I chose the middle one. Not too rusty, not too clean. Perfect for me. 

Oh and you have to bargain. Hard. I didn't know know how to say 400K, so I just wrote it down on a piece of paper. He replied with 450K and we had a deal. This felt like communicating with someone over instant messages haha. But even more interactive.


## What do you get

Hipster bike for a very reasonable price. And if you have an iPhone, some old school clothes and Instagram, man, you are a true hipster. And you can ride your bicycle proudly.

The bike comes with a front storage, which is very useful. You don't have to use bags or backpacks for your groceries. Just put it into the basket and you are good to go.

Bicycle has integrated locker. This one comes very handy, because you don't have to carry anything. Just a key. That is it. I love this system. I wish european bikes had the same feature.

Actually, it is for two persons, but I have never tried it. I would be scared shitless to do it with somebody behind my back on this roads. That would be an insta suicide. But still, some people do it. But they are locals, means that they are more tiny. But I cannot really imagine two European fellas on it. It would crack for sure.
