I have been trying to add some weight for a long time. I have never experienced the feeling of **gaining the weight**. Just never happened to me (sad panda)

But I finally realized what was holding me back. **MYSELF!** What a surprise, right?

I am an **ectomorph** and I was using this as an excuse for such a long a time. Now, it is time to change it. This is gonna be the final solution.

Ok, some facts:

Current weight: 68,6 kgs (151,24 lbs)

Height: 185 cm (6,07 feet)

Age: 23

Here are theÂ <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>pictures</strong></span> of my body. I do not have any friends, and that is why I had to makeÂ the selfies.

## Pictures

## Goals are super simple

  * train at least 4 times a week (training specified below)
  * eat 5 times a day (meals written below)
  * gain as much weight as possible
  * transform myself visually as much as possible
  * all of things stated above are happening in next 28 days

## What I have to do to get there

  * get enough **rest** (also nap once a day if I feel like it)
  * get plenty of **water** (I underestimated this in the past &#8211; not gonna do the same mistake again) &#8211; actually I start my day with water
  * oxygen &#8211; yup, gotta go outside everyday
  * train (you did not expect that, huh? :D)
  * eat 5x/day (beans, chicken, rice, oat meal, soy milk, pasta, peanut butter, eggs, vegetable, fruit)

## How do I train

90 % of the training is going to be with my **bodyweight**. 10 % is gonna be squats &#8211; definitely and dead lifts &#8211; if I feel like it.

And routine&#8230; Well, I will create a ton of different ones. Sometimes I will train to failure. Sometimes just with 5&#215;5/5&#215;6 protocol. It depends.

But main **pulling** exercise: pull ups and its variations.

Main exercise for **pushing**: push ups, dips, pseudo planche push ups and so on.

Main **core** exercises: plank, hanging leg raise (prolly tucked, aint got enough compression strength) and others, but I dont know how are they called, haha.

**Lower body**:Â goblet squat, sprints, bulgarian split squats, pistol squats (if I got enough mobity for them, but prolly not :P), glute ham raise would be the nuts, but I am not sure whether I have the equip for them.

## <span style="color: #ff6600;">Guess my weight after the challenge and win 28 EUR!</span>

It is really simple.

Just try to guess what my bodyweight will be after 28 days and win **28,- EUR**

Rules:

  1. Every person can guess just once
  2. Your guess cannot be changed
  3. You have 72 hours to make a guess after the challenge starts
  4. If there are two or more same guesses I will use random number generator to determine the winner
  5. I can pay on SK bank account, Skrill, Paypal or PS (yeah, you guys know what I mean :D) &#8211; which means, that you need some of these 4 to get your money. Actually Skrill/Paypal is easy to make ðŸ™‚
  6. Only guesses that are posted here will be accepted
  7. Guess the weight after 28 days and state your name + first letter of your surname (example: 100 kgs, Viliam B.)
