Some of my friends told me that I should post more pictrues.

Thanks for the feedback guys! Brainstorming vibe is real. And I am grateful for that, because 11 brains is hell of a force, as opposed to just one lil tiny brain.

This article is gonna be uber short. I am gonna provide you with some basic info and then boom &#8211; pictures all over the place.

# Here is the basic info about my place

I live in On Nut area. Which is located at Sukhumvit road.

They say it is a very convenient location, cause you do not live downtown, but you are very close to it. (cannot say for sure, cause I have never been there, lol)

Some things we got here:

  * 25 m swimming pool
  * gym &#8211; tbh it looks like a kids playground, they do not even have bars
  * sauna &#8211; dry one, and you can set the tempretare for yourself
  * lift &#8211; always good, when you live on 18th floor, right?
  * lobby &#8211; so it is like a classic flat, but with lobby downstairs (probably cause of the security reasons)

Ok, now specifics of my room:

  * no idea how many square meters it has (it is rather small, but fine for 1 guy)
  * I sleep, work, cook and eat in the same room
  * got tiny balcony with washing mashine for 9 kgs of dirty laundry
  * air conditioning is a standard here, otherwise you would turn into a KFC chicken pretty fast
  * I live on 18th floor, so view is very nice

Price: is 320 EUR without energies. So it depends what kind of a person you are.

# Here it comes, baby, the pictuuuuuuuuures (as authentic as it gets)
