It's 2 a.m. now. I'm in my hometown, in Slovakia. But that's not what I wanna talk about.

It's been a pleasure to provide you with stories from my life guys. I am very thankful for your support and obviously for reading this blog.

I wanna say thanks to all of you who has been reading this or who has showed me the other way of thinking about the things.

First I wanna say big thanks to whole Bkk crew: Father J., Glenn, Liv, Tomas, Oli, Rene, Klaus, Tobi, Ploy, Alpha Delivery Guy, Mrs. Cook, Neng. I hope that I put here all of you :D

Then I wanna say thank you for everybody who I met during my "travels": One Armed Guy, Russel, Jagath, Mick, German girl, Lea, Alex DE+KZ, Julia, Marisa, crazy Mojo Sons, Tony the lordmaster, great cooks and whole staff in Bo De in Nha Trang, Natasha, Natasha and the third girl (sorry for forgetting your name, because I liked you the most), taxi drivers in Bangkok and every other person who I cannot recall right now. Which I'm sorry for.

And last, but not least to all SK/CZ readers: Marcus P., Alex Em, Matsach, Mangudai and everybody else. I'm sorry, but I don't know who else was reading this :D

This doesn't mean, that I'm not gonna post anymore. 

I am just getting back to my native tongue - Slovak. I feel much more comfortable expressing myself in my native language. Also, I feel like I can play with the words much better. But that's not the point of this post.

Your support has helped me a lot. We will meet again, if we are supposed to meet. So (probably) see you.
